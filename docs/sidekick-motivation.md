# Motivation for the Sidekick System

## Identified Need: Control Systems and Intense Laser Laboratories
High-repetition-rate, high-power lasers will result in orders of magnitude more digital data than our field is accustomed to managing. All members of the high-intensity laser-plasma physics community are stakeholders in data and control systems for the next generation of higher-repetition-rate experiments.

## Alternative Solutions: Centralized vs Distributed Control Systems
Centralized data systems are common at high-intensity laser facilities and have permitted great science with small-scale data. A single computer manages data acquisition, analysis, storage, and visualization for each of its instruments. Unfortunately, centralized systems will struggle to scale to higher data rates and heavier data analysis for synchronous acquisitions across many instruments.

Distributed data systems permit data to be acquired, analyzed, and stored at different locations throughout a laboratory. Adding and removing components in a distributed data system does not require central coordination. This makes the distributed data approach ideal for collaborations of scientists in our community, where scientific instruments and techniques travel between facilities. However, building a performant, maintainable distributed data system with experimental physics skillsets can be daunting!

### EPICS: Distributed Control for Scientists
[EPICS](https://epics-controls.org/) is a distributed control system architecture with a large user community in experimental physics. It is entirely open source and has workshops, active development, and active community support. EPICS is used at over a hundred worldwide physics facilities including LIGO, ITER, and SLAC.

EPICS is clearly performant, and has the necessary community support â€“ but is the learning curve too steep for staff and students at our smaller university-scale laser facilities?

## Prototype: The Sidekick System
We set out to demonstrate a simple control system feedback loop in EPICS that still maintains levels of relevance to laser laboratories. We nicknamed this the "sidekick system".

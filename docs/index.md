# Welcome to the documentation for Sidekick Facilities!

The goal of "sidekick facilities" is to prototype control systems and digital data pipelines for real-world high-intensity laser facilities. On this website you will find an overview of our project, as well as detailed instructions on setting up your own sidekick facilities from scratch.

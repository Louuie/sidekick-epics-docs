# Sidekick EPICS Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Sidekick EPICS system! 

The goal of the sidekick system is to model some of the challenges of control systems for a real-world high-intensity laser system.

On this website you will find an overview of the sidekick system, as well as detailed instructions on setting up your own from scratch.

## What are your team's qualifications to build this?
Scott Feister has worked with and made additions to several control systems at high-intensity laser facilities. He has watched what works and what doesn't work in high-repetition-rate data acquisition at these facilities, and learned from his own mistakes there as well. Keily Valdez Sereno and Emiko Ito are undergraduates in Mechatronics Engineering with experience developing 3D CAD models and software for robotics.

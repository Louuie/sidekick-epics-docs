## The Team
The sidekick facilities documented in this website were created through a several-year collaboration between California State University Channel Islands and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

### California State University Channel Islands (CSUCI)
This project was initiated at CSUCI as a testbed on which we could learn EPICS, and has grown much larger since. CSUCI is still the primary site for development of new sidekick facilities.
